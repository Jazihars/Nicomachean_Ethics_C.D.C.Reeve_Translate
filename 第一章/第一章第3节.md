# 第一章第3节

Our account will be adequate if its degree of perspicuity is in accord with its subject matter. For we must not look for the same degree of exactness in all accounts, any more than in all products of the crafts.

如果我们的叙述的透彻程度与其主题相符，那么我们的叙述就是合适的。正如我们不能要求所有的手工艺制品都拥有完全一样的精确程度，我们也不能要求所有的叙述都具有同样的精确程度。

Noble things and just things, which are what politics investigates, admit of so much difference and variability that they seem to exist by conventional law alone and not by nature. Good things seem to admit of variability in the same way too, because they result in harm in many cases, since some have in fact been destroyed because of wealth, others because of courage. So it should content us, in an account that concerns and is in accord with such things, to show the truth roughly and in outline, and—in an account that concerns things that hold for the most part and is in accord with them—to reach conclusions of the same sort too. It is in the same way, then, that we also need to take each of the things we say. For it is characteristic of a well-educated person to look for the degree of exactness in each kind of investigation that the nature of the subject itself allows. For it is evident that accepting persuasive arguments from a mathematician is like demanding demonstrations from a rhetorician.

政治学研究高尚的事物和正义的事物，这些事物具有相当大的差异和可变性，因此它们的存在似乎仅仅是由于约定，而不是由于自然。美好的事物似乎也有同样的可变性，因为它们在许多情况下都会造成伤害，因为事实上有些人因财富而毁灭，有些人因勇敢而丧命。因此，在涉及并与这些少数情况一致的论述中，我们应该满足于粗略地、概括地说明真理，而在涉及并与大多数情况一致的论述中，我们也应该满足于得出与大多数情况相同的结论。因此，我们也需要以同样的方式来看待我们所说的每件事。因为一个受过良好教育的人的特点是，在每种研究中，都要在研究对象本身的性质所允许的范围内追求精确性。显然，接受一个数学粗略的表述，就像要求一个修辞学家给出证明一样地不合理。

But each person correctly discerns the things he knows and is a good discerner of these. Hence a person well educated in a given area is a good discerner in that area, while a person well educated in all areas is an unconditionally good discerner. That is why a young person is not a suitable audience for politics. For he has no experience of the actions of life, and the accounts are in accord with these and concerned with these.

但是，每个人都能正确地辨别他所了解的事物，并且在这些事物上是一个很好的辨别者。因此，一个在某一领域能够作出很好分辨的人是在这一领域受过良好教育的人，而一个在所有领域都能够作出很好分辨的人就是在所有领域都受过良好教育的人。这就是为什么年轻人不适合学习政治学。因为他对人的行为没有经验，而政治学恰恰是与人的行为一致的，并关乎于人的行为的。

Further, since he tends to follow his feelings, it will be pointless and not beneficial for him to be in the audience, since the end is not knowledge but action. And it makes no difference whether he is young in years or immature in character, since the deficiency is not a matter of time but is due to living and pursuing each thing in accord with his feelings. For to people like that, knowledge turns out to be profitless in just the way it does to those who lack self-control. For those who form their desires and do their actions in accord with reason, however, it will be of great benefit to know about these things.

此外，既然年轻人倾向于跟着感觉走，那么他去学习政治学就没有意义，也没有好处，因为学习政治学的最终的目的不是知识，而是行动。而且，无论他是年轻还是性格不成熟，这都没有什么区别，因为他们的缺点不是因为时间不够，而是因为他们在生活中和追求每一事物时都跟随自己的感觉。知识对这样的人来说是毫无益处的，就像对那些缺乏自制力的人一样。然而，对于那些按照理性来形成自己的欲求并行动的人来说，了解这些事情将大有裨益。

So much for the prefatory remarks concerning the audience, how our discussion is to be received, and what we are proposing to do.

关于什么样的人适合学习政治学，如何看待我们的讨论以及我们接下来打算做什么的前言就到此为止了。
