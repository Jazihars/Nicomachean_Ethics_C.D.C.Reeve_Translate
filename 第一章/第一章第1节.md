# 第一章第1节

Every craft and every method of inquiry and likewise every action and deliberate choice seems to seek some good. That is why they correctly declare that the good is “that which all seek.”

每种技艺、每种研究方法，同样地，每一个行动、每一个深思熟虑的选择似乎都在寻求某种善。这就是为什么人们正确地宣称，善是“所有人都在追求的东西”。

A certain difference, however, appears to exist among ends. For some are activities while others are works of some sort beyond the activities themselves. But wherever there are ends beyond the actions, in those cases, the works are naturally better than the activities. But since there are many sorts of actions and of crafts and sciences, their ends are many as well. For health is the end of medicine, a ship of shipbuilding, victory of generalship, and wealth of household management.

然而，目的之间似乎存在着某种差异。因为有些目的是活动本身，而另一些则是超越活动本身的某种工作。只要有超越活动本身的目的，在这种情况下，（超越活动本身的）工作自然比活动本身更好。但是，既然行为、技艺和科学有很多种，它们的目的也就有很多种。医学的目的是健康，造船术的目的是船只，用兵之术的目的是胜利，家政管理的目的是财富。

Some of these fall under some one capacity, however, as bridle making falls under horsemanship, along with all the others that produce equipment for horsemanship, and as it and every action in warfare fall under generalship, and, in the same way, others fall under different ones. But in all such cases, the ends of the architectonic ones are more choiceworthy than the ends under them, since these are pursued for the sake also of the former. It makes no difference, though, whether the ends of the actions are the activities themselves or some other thing beyond them, just as in the sciences we have mentioned.


然而，其中有些技艺属于某一种能力的范畴，就像马笼头的制作属于骑术的范畴，而其他所有为骑术提供装备的行为都属于骑术的范畴。和骑术一样，战争中的所有行为都属于用兵之术的范畴。同样，其他行为也属于不同的范畴。但在所有这些情况下，主导技艺的目的比其下的从属技艺的目的更值得选择，因为这些从属技艺的目的也是为了前者而追求的。不过，行动的目的是活动本身还是活动之外的其他东西，这并没有什么区别，就像我们提到的科学一样。
