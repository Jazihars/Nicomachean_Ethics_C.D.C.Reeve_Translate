# 第一章第5节

But let us take up our account at the point where we digressed. People seem (which is not unreasonable) to get their suppositions about the good—that is, happiness—from their lives. For ordinary people, the most vulgar ones, suppose it to be pleasure. And that is why the life they like is the life of indulgence. For there are three lives that stand out: the one we just mentioned, the political, and, third, the contemplative.

但是，让我们从我们离题的地方继续说下去。人们似乎（这并不是没有道理的）从他们的生活中获得了关于美好，也就是幸福的假设。普通人，最庸俗的人，都认为幸福就是快乐。这就是为什么他们喜欢的生活是放纵的生活。因为有三种生活很突出：一种是我们刚才提到的，一种是政治生活，第三种是沉思生活。

---

Now ordinary people do seem wholly slavish, because the life they deliberately choose is one that is characteristic of grazing cattle. They have an argument for their choice, though, because many of those in positions of authority feel the same as Sardanapalus.

Sophisticated people, on the other hand, and doers of action, deliberately choose honor, since it is pretty much the end of the political life. It, however, is apparently more superficial than what we are looking for, since it seems to be in the hands of the honorers more than of the honorees, whereas we have a hunch that the good is something that properly belongs to us and is difficult to take away. Further, people seem to pursue honor in order to be convinced that they are good—at any rate, they seek to be honored by practically-wise people, among people who know them, and for virtue. It is clear, then, that according to them, at least, virtue is better.

Maybe one might even suppose that it is more the end of the political life than honor is. But even virtue is apparently too incomplete, since it seems possible to have virtue even while sleeping or being inactive throughout life or while suffering evils and bad luck of the worst sort. Someone who was living like that, however, no one would call happy unless he was defending a thesis at all costs. That is enough about these issues, since they have also been adequately discussed in the works that are in circulation.

The third life is the contemplative one, which we shall undertake to investigate in what follows.

The life of a moneymaker is in a way forced, and wealth is clearly not the good we are looking for, since it is useful and for the sake of something else. Hence we might be more inclined to suppose that the things already mentioned are the end, since they are liked because of themselves. But they are apparently not the end either—indeed, many arguments have been presented against them. So we may set them aside.



现在看来，普通人确实完全是奴性的，因为他们刻意选择的生活是放牧牛群特有的生活。不过，他们的选择是有道理的，因为许多身居要职的人和萨达纳帕卢斯的感受是一样的。

另一方面，老练的人和行动者会刻意选择荣誉，因为这几乎是政治生活的终点。然而，它显然比我们所追求的更加肤浅，因为它似乎更多地是掌握在荣誉者的手中，而我们却直觉地认为，美好的东西是属于我们自己的，是难以夺走的。此外，人们追求荣誉似乎是为了让人相信他们是好的--无论如何，他们寻求被有实践智慧的人、在了解他们的人中间以及因为美德而获得荣誉。显然，至少在他们看来，美德是更好的。

甚至可以说，德行比荣誉更能体现政治生活的目的。但即使是美德，显然也是不全面的，因为即使是在睡觉或终生无所事事或遭受最糟糕的邪恶和厄运时，似乎也有可能拥有美德。然而，这样生活的人，除非不惜一切代价为论文辩护，否则没有人会说他是幸福的。关于这些问题就讲到这里，因为在流传的作品中也已经对它们进行了充分的讨论。

第三种生活是沉思的生活，我们将在下文中对此进行研究。

赚钱者的生活在某种程度上是被迫的，而财富显然不是我们所追求的美好，因为它是有用的，是为了别的东西。因此，我们可能更倾向于认为上述事物是目的，因为它们本身就令人喜爱。但它们显然也不是目的--事实上，已经有许多论据反对它们。因此，我们可以把它们放在一边。
