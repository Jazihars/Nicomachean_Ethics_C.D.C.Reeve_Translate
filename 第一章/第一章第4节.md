# 第一章第4节

Let us, then, resume our account. Since every sort of knowledge and every deliberate choice reaches after some good, let us say what it is politics seeks—that is, what the topmost of all the good things doable in action is.

我们继续讨论。既然每一种知识和每一个深思熟虑的选择都是为了追求某种善，那么我们看看政治学追求的是什么，也就是说，在所有行动可以做到的所有善中，最高的善是什么。

About its name, most people are pretty much agreed, since both ordinary people and sophisticated ones say it is “happiness” and suppose that living well and doing well are the same as being happy. Concerning happiness, however, and what it is, they are in dispute, and ordinary people do not give the same answer as wise ones. For ordinary people think it is one of the plainly evident things, such as pleasure or wealth or honor—some taking it to be one thing, others another. And often the same person thinks it is different things, since when he gets a disease, it is health, whereas when he is poor, it is wealth. But when these people are conscious of their own ignorance they are wonder-struck by those who proclaim some great thing that is over their heads. And some people did used to think that, beyond these many good things, there is another intrinsically good one that causes all of them to be good.

关于这种最高的善的名称，大多数人的看法基本一致，因为无论是一般大众还是那些出众的人，都说它是“幸福”，并认为生活得好和工作得好就等于幸福。然而，涉及到幸福以及幸福是什么，他们却存在争议，普通人和有智慧的人给出的答案并不相同。因为普通人认为幸福是清楚明白显而易见的事情之一，比如快乐、财富或荣誉——有些人认为是其中之一，有些人则认为是另一个。同一个人往往也会认为幸福是不同的东西，因为当他生病时，他认为健康就是幸福，而当他贫穷时，他认为财富就是幸福。但是，当这些人意识到自己的无知时，他们就会对那些宣扬某种超乎他们想象的伟大事物的人感到震惊。有些人曾经认为，在这些美好的事物之外，还有一个使所有这些事物美好的，本质上善的事物。

Now it is presumably quite pointless to inquire into all these beliefs, and enough to inquire into those that are most prevalent or that seem to have some argument for them.

现在，研究所有这些信念大概是毫无意义的，只需研究那些最普遍的或似乎有一定道理的信念就足够了。

---

We must not let it escape our notice, however, that arguments leading from starting-points and arguments leading to starting-points are different. For Plato too was rightly puzzled about this and would inquire whether the route was leading from starting-points or to starting-points—as, in a stadium racecourse, that of the athletes may lead away from the starting-point toward the boundary or in the reverse direction. We must indeed start from things that are knowable. But things are knowable in two ways, since some are knowable to us, some unconditionally. So presumably we should start from things knowable to us.

然而，我们不能不注意到，从起点出发的论证和走向起点的论证是不同的。柏拉图对此也感到困惑，他会研究路线是从起点出发还是走向起点，就像在体育场的赛马跑道上，运动员的路线可能从起点出发通往终点，也可能走在相反的方向上。我们确实必须从对我们可知的事物出发。但可知的事物有两种方式为我们可知，因为有些是对我们来说可知的，有些是无条件可知的。因此，我们大概应该从对我们来说可知的事物出发。

That is why we must be nobly brought up if, where noble things, just things, and the topics of politics as a whole are concerned, we are to be an adequate audience. For the starting-point is the fact that something is so, and, if this is sufficiently evident, we do not also need the explanation of why it is so. A nobly brought up person, then, either has the starting-points or can easily get hold of them. And as for someone who neither has nor can get hold of them, he should listen to Hesiod:

```
Best of all is the one who understands everything himself,
Good too is that person who is persuaded by one that has spoken well.
But he who neither understands it himself nor listening to another
Takes it to heart, that one is a useless man.
```


正因为如此，如果我们要成为高贵的事物、正义的事物以及整个政治学话题的合适听众，我们就必须接受高贵的培养。因为这就是我们事实上的出发点，如果这一点足够明显，我们就不需要解释为何如此。因此，一个受过高贵培养的人，要么拥有这些出发点，要么很容易掌握这些出发点。至于既没有也不可能掌握这些出发点的人，他应该听听赫西俄德的忠告：

```
最好的人就是自己能够明白一切的人、
能够被一个说得很好的人说服的人也是很好的人。
但是那些既不能自己明白，也不听别人忠告的人，
记住，那就是无用之人。
```
